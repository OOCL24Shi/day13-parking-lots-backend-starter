Objective: Today, we explored how artificial intelligence can help with programming and pair programming. We discussed how to incorporate these AI tools into our coding processes and examined various tools to assist in writing, debugging, and improving code.

Reflection: Impressed

Interpretive: By automating repetitive tasks and providing immediate feedback, AI in pair programming can speed up development while maintaining high code quality. The tools we reviewed show that they can be useful for any team because they can adapt to a variety of coding styles and project needs.

Decision: To increase productivity and improve the quality of our code, I plan to start using an AI coding assistant on a regular basis and integrate AI-driven pair programming sessions.
