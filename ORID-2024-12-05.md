Objective: Today we focus on agile processes, exploring iteration cycles, user story maps, and tips for writing effective user story cards.

Reflection: I really appreciate how user story maps help us visualize the project from the user's perspective, which makes it easier to identify and prioritize features.

Interpretive: Understanding iteration cycles is critical to planning our sprints and ensuring continued progress. Learn to write clear user story cards to keep your team aligned and focused on delivering value.

Decision: I plan to incorporate user story mapping into our next project and practice making detailed user story cards to enhance our agile workflow and team collaboration.
